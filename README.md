# TicTacToe
This is a simple TicTacToe game app for Android devices, developed by Abhaynand Kumar, a student of IIIT Gwalior.

## Overview
This app features a single activity with an interactive user interface and color, developed using Java and XML. The app allows two players to take turns marking the spaces in a 3x3 grid with X and O symbols, with the goal of getting three in a row.

## How to Play
1. Start the app on your Android device.
2. Two players should take turns tapping on the squares of the 3x3 grid to mark them with X and O symbols.
3. The first player to get three of their symbols in a row (horizontally, vertically, or diagonally) wins the game.
4. If all nine squares are marked and no player has won, the game is a draw.
